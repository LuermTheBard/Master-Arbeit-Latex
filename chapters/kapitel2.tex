\chapter{Campaign and Analysis}
\label{campaign_and_analysis}
The Analysis of this campaign bases of the observation campaign of NGC4593 in 2016 by Edward M. Cackett \parencite{cackett2018accretion}. The observations took place between the 12th of July and the 6th of August with 26 successful observations out of 27 and was performed with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) using the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The following section will cover important properties of NGC4593 and the 2016 campaign.

\section{NGC4593}
\label{NGC4593}

NGC 4593 is an active galactic nucleus (AGN), classified as a Seyfert 1 galaxy with a \mbox{(R)SB(rs)b} barred spiral morphology. 
It is located in the southern sky at RA = 12:39:39.44, DEC = $-05$Â°$ 20' 39.03''$ (J2000) and has a redshift of $z = 0.0083 \pm 0.0005$, corresponding to a distance of about $35.6$ Mpc \parencite{simbaNGC4593} based on the $\Lambda$CDM model. 
The galaxy exhibits a prominent large-scale bar and nuclear dust ring connected to dust lanes along the bar, which likely channel gas toward the central region \parencite{mulchaey1997structure}, as seen in figure \ref{fig:NGC4593}. 
The AGN shows strong broad emission lines in  H$\alpha$,  H$\beta$,  H$\gamma$, Ly$\alpha$, He\,\textsc{i}, and He\,\textsc{ii} \parencite{bentz2015agn}, indicating a well-developed broad-line region. 
Reverberation mapping of the broad H$\beta$ line yields a supermassive black hole mass of $M = \left(7.63 \pm 1.62\right) \times 10^6\,M_\odot$ \parencite{bentz2015agn}, with a corresponding broad-line region radius of only a few light-days \parencite{denney2006ngc4593}. 
Multi-wavelength monitoring has revealed strong variability from X-ray to optical bands, with interband time delays indicating a UV/optical-emitting accretion disk about three times larger than predicted by standard thin-disk theory and signatures of diffuse continuum emission from the BLR, particularly around the Balmer jump \parencite{cackett2018accretion}. 
ALMA observations further reveal a central molecular gas reservoir of $\sim 10^8\,M_\odot$ arranged in a one-armed spiral and a circumnuclear ring, as well as evidence for a mild molecular outflow on scales of a few hundred parsecs \parencite{garcia2019alma}, highlighting the interplay between bar-driven inflow and AGN feedback in this galaxy.

\section{2016 Campaign by E. M. Cackett}
\label{Campaign_Cackett}

E. M. Cackett's campaign was designed to study wavelength dependent continuum lags. Therefore, the STIS instrument on the Hubble Space Telescope was used with low-resolution gratings to measure a broad range of wavelengths. In each observation, spectra were taken using three different gratings: G140L, G430L, and G750L. These were used together with the $52'' \times 0.2''$ slit.\\
The characteristics of the STIS gratings used in this analysis are summarized in Table \ref{tab:stis_gratings}. After a standard pipeline-processing, a package was used to do a Charge Transfer Inefficiency correction with an algorithm based on \parencite{anderson2010empirical}. The few left rest of hot pixels got manually removed by interpolating the flux of neighbor pixels.\\

\section{Intercalibration and Determination of AVG and RMS spectra}

To perform a reverberation mapping analysis, it is essential to have multiple observations of the object to analyze its variability. For the 2016 campaign of NGC 4593, 26 out of 27 observations are usable. The epochs were downloaded from the ... archive, and the faulty observation was removed from further analysis. The top panel of Figure \ref{fig:comparison_spectra} shows parts of the optical spectral range of those epochs.\\
For the subsequent analysis, an average spectrum (AVG) is obtained by averaging over all epochs. In the best case, this results in a signal-to-noise ratio that allows one to identify spectral features of NGC 4593's spectrum. Furthermore, it is essential to identify variability between the epochs, which can be obtained with the root-mean-square (RMS) spectrum. It is calculated as the standard deviation of the flux at each wavelength across all epochs:
\begin{equation}
	F_{\mathrm{RMS}}(\lambda) = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \left(F_i(\lambda) - \bar{F}(\lambda)\right)^2 } \,,
\end{equation}
with the mean spectrum at wavelength $\lambda$:
\begin{equation}
	\bar{F}(\lambda) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} F_i(\lambda) \,.
\end{equation}

Constant features, such as narrow emission lines, should disappear from the RMS spectrum, whereas variable features, like broad emission lines, become strongly enhanced. In the top panel of Figure \ref{fig:comparison_spectra_avg_rms}, the results of the AVG and RMS spectra of the original data are shown. However, the RMS spectrum still shows variation for non-varying lines, especially for the forbidden lines at about $5000\,\text{\AA}$. This indicates a wavelength shift between different epochs, which can be fixed by an intercalibration based on a narrow line. Here, it is convenient to use the forbidden line [O \textsc{iii}] $\lambda5007$ for the intercalibration. The lower panels of Figures \ref{fig:comparison_spectra} and \ref{fig:comparison_spectra_avg_rms} show the intercalibrated versions of the epochs, as well as the AVG and RMS spectra.\\
While the difference is not easy to see in the direct comparison of epochs in Figure \ref{fig:comparison_spectra}, the RMS spectra of the intercalibrated epochs show no residual variation in the narrow lines, indicating that the earlier variation was indeed due to a wavelength shift. If not explicit mentioned, the intercalibrated version of the AVG- and RMS-spectra will be used in the following analysis.
