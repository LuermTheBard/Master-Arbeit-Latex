\section{Line Identification}

The first step of the reverberation mapping analysis is the identification of emission and absorption lines within the AVG spectrum. Figures  \ref{fig:AVG_RMS_SPECTRUM} and \ref{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS} show the optical to near-infrared range between $3900 \AA$ and $9000 \AA$ and the UV range between $1100 \AA$ and $1700 \AA$, respectively. 
Looking at Figure \ref{fig:AVG_RMS_SPECTRUM}, it is possible to identify prominent broad emission lines in the AVG spectrum are the Balmer-Lines up to H$\epsilon$, with H$\alpha$ being the strongest followed by H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$, and several He-emission lines such as He\,I$\lambda 4471$, He\,II $\lambda 4685$, the He\,I $\lambda 5015$, He\,I $\lambda 5875$, He\,I $\lambda 7065$. Another significant broad emission line complex appears in the NIR part of the spectrum, including the O\textsc{i}$\,\lambda8446$ emission line and the Ca\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda8498\,\lambda8542\,\lambda8662$ triplet. All of those lines show significant variation in the RMS, especially the Balmer-lines and the He\,II $\lambda 4685$ and He\,I $\lambda 5875$ with very good distinguishable profiles. The He\,I$\lambda 4471$, the He\,I $\lambda 5015$, the He\,I $\lambda 7065$, the O\textsc{i}$\,\lambda8446$ emission line and the Ca\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda8498\,\lambda8542\,\lambda8662$ triplet show smaller but still noticeable variation. The He\,I$\lambda 4471$ and He\,I $\lambda 5875$ lines are blended with a Fe II emission line group in the AVG, which is vanishing in the RMS, as it shows no variation. The same aplies to the Fe II emission line group around 5200 \AA.\\
Apart from the broad emission lines, the AVG spectrum shows strong forbidden [O\,III] narrow emission lines. [O\,III] $\lambda 5007$ and [O\,III] $\lambda 4958$ are strong enough to be distinguishable, while the [O\,III] $\lambda 4363$ blends with H$\gamma$. As narrow lines they and several more weaker narrow lines, show no variability in the RMS spectrum over the period of the campaign.

	\label{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS}
\end{figure}\\
The campaign also included an UV spectrum between $1000$ \AA and $1700$ \AA, which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS}. The most prominent broad lines in the UV spectrum are the Ly$\alpha$ line, which is blended with the N\,V $\lambda\lambda 1238,1242$ duplet, the Si\,IV$\lambda\lambda 1393,1402$ duplet, which is blended with a partly forbidden O\,IV] line, and the  C\,IV$\lambda\lambda 1548,1550$ duplet. They all show strong variation in the RMS spectrum. Apart of the strong lines, a weaker variable Helium II line can be identified at $1640$ \AA.  \\
The Bowen fluorescence of O\,I $\lambda 8446$, which is investigated in this analysis, is typical driven by the emission of the Ly$\beta$ line \parencite{grandi1980}, which lies outside the spectral range of the HST Campaign. However, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS}, Ly$\alpha$  still lies in the spectral range of the campaign, as the bluest broad line of the taken spectra. As Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ are assumed to originate in the same physical region, Ly$_\alpha$ can be used to examine the correlation of O\,I $\lambda 8446$ and Ly$\alpha$ for Bowen fluorescence.


\section{Emission Line and Continua Measurement}

After identifying the emission lines, the next step of the analysis is to measure the fluxes of those lines. This is done with the help of a python-based tool called GECHO created by M. Probst. It enables to import full campaigns, determine the AVG and RMS spectra, extracting lightcurves and do further measurements, naming here line-width measurements and lags measurement using the ICCF methode \parencite{gaskell_peterson1986, peterson2004}, which will be further discussed in Section \ref{sec:line_profiles} and \ref{sec:time_lag_bh_mass}.\\
With help of GECHO the flux density gets integrated over the extent of each emission line for every observed spectrum of the campaign. Here it is important to define the integration limits so that all of the emission line flux is measured in this way. To ensure this, a parallel view of the AVG- and RMS-spectrum was used to define those integration limits, and to ensured, that no component of any other line is contributing to the line flux of the measured line. Additionally, the integration boundaries get selected, making sure they span a similar area in velocity space for every emission line. To accounting the surrounding continuum a linear underlying continuum gets interpolated and subtracted first. For this interpolation, sections on the blue and red side of the emission line with no line contribution gets selected. The chosen integration limits and pseudo-continua are listed in Table \ref{tab:emission_lines}. \\
To measure the delay between the ionizing continuum and the emission lines it is necessary to extract lightcurves of selected continua in the AVG spectrum. Continua lightcurves are getting extracted by measuring the mean flux density of a sufficiently large region without line emission or absorption. The chosen integration limits for the continua can be found in Table \ref{tab:continua}.\\

\subsection{Variability Statistics}

To quantify the variability of the emission lines and continua variability statistics the definition by \cite{rodriguez1997steps} are adopted. They name the  maximum-to-minimum flux ratio $R_\mathrm{max}$ and the fractional variability	$F_\mathrm{var}$ as two common measures of variability. $R_\mathrm{max}$ is defined as the ratio of the the extreme of the integrated fluxes, $F_\mathrm{min}$ and $F_\mathrm{max}$, and  $F_\mathrm{var}$ as: 
\begin{equation}
	F_\mathrm{var}=\frac{\sqrt{\sigma_F^2-\Delta^2}}{\left<F\right>}
\end{equation}
Here, $\sigma_F^2$ denotes the standard deviation, $\left<F\right>$ the mean flux and $\Delta^2$ the mean square value of the flux uncertainties, which is defined by:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\Delta_i^2
\end{equation}
The results for all parameters can be found in the Tables \ref{tab:varstatistics}.\\
First, considering $R_\mathrm{max}$ and $F_\mathrm{var}$ of the continuum lightcurves, all measured continua show similar variability, except for the UV continuum around $1150$ \AA, which shows significantly higher variability with $R_\mathrm{max} = 2.58$ and $F_\mathrm{var} = 0.28$ than the optical and NIR continua. These continua show a fairly uniform variation between $R_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1.33-1.59$ and $F_\mathrm{var} \simeq 0.08-0.14$. \\
The lightcurves of the Balmer emission lines exhibit lower variability, which increases towards the higher-order Balmer lines, with values between $R_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1.15-1.52$ and $F_\mathrm{var} \simeq 0.03-0.1$. The helium lightcurves show a similar variability to H$\delta$ with values  between $R_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1.48-1.62$ and $F_\mathrm{var} \simeq 0.09-0.11$ and the OI$\,\lambda 8446$ a similar variability to the lower-order balmer lines with $R_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1.22$ and $F_\mathrm{var} \simeq 0.04$.\\
The variability of the emission line lightcurves in the UV region is on a similar level as that of the helium light curves in the optical region, with $R_\mathrm{max} \simeq 1.42-1.62$ and $F_\mathrm{var} \simeq 0.14$, with the exception of the HeII$,\lambda1640$ lightcurve, which shows significant higher variability with $R_\mathrm{max} \simeq 3.12$ and $F_\mathrm{var} \simeq 0.31$.

\subsection{Uncertainties Estimation}
The uncertainties of the continuum and emission-line lightcurves are estimated from two components. The first component originates from the noise in the flux densities over the pixels within the integration bounds, $N_\mathrm{pixel}$. For the continuum lightcurves, the noise uncertainty is estimated as 
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_\mathrm{noise}^{\mathrm{cont}} = \frac{\sigma_F}{\sqrt{N_\mathrm{pixel}^{\mathrm{cont}}}}, 
\end{equation} 
where $\sigma_F$ denotes the standard deviation of the flux density within the selected continuum window. Since the emission-line lightcurves are extracted by integrating the continuum-subtracted flux density, the corresponding noise uncertainty is estimated using the noise measured from the used  pseudo-continua, $\sigma_\mathrm{noise}^{\mathrm{p.cont.}}$:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_\mathrm{noise}^{\mathrm{lines}} = \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{noise}^{\mathrm{p.cont.}} \cdot \Delta\lambda}{\sqrt{N_\mathrm{pixel}^{\mathrm{line}}}}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta\lambda$ denotes the integration window used for the emission line, and $N_\mathrm{pixel}^{\mathrm{line}}$ denotes the number of pixels within this window.
\\
The second component originates from the intercalibration of the epochs of the campaign. The flux of each epoch is scaled based on the narrow emission line [O\,\textsc{iii}] $\lambda5007$, which is assumed to be constant over the campaign. To account for the systematic uncertainty introduced by the intercalibration, the fractional variability of [O\,\textsc{iii}] $\lambda5007$ is multiplied by the integrated flux values $f_i$  and used as a proxy for the intercalibration uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_i^\mathrm{cal.} = F_\mathrm{var}^{\mathrm{[O\,\textsc{iii}]}\,\lambda5007} \cdot f_i .
\end{equation}
This yields the total light-curve uncertainty:
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_i = \sqrt{\left(\sigma_i^\mathrm{cal.}\right)^2 + \left(\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}\right)^2} ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{\mathrm{noise}}$ corresponds to $\sigma_\mathrm{noise}^{\mathrm{cont}}$ for continuum light curves and to $\sigma_\mathrm{noise}^{\mathrm{lines}}$ for emission-line light curves.

\section{Lightcurves}
\label{sec:lightcurves}
The extracted lightcurves of the continua and emission lines are shown in Figures \ref{fig:continua_lightcurves}, \ref{fig:emission_line_lightcurves}, and \ref{fig:UV_emission_line_lightcurves}. In addition to the measured lightcurves of the HST campaign, the UVOT UVW2 lightcurve taken with \textit{Swift} by \cite{mchardy2018x}, which was also used in \cite{cackett2018accretion}, is included in this analysis, as it has a higher sampling rate than the light curves of the HST campaign. The spectra were taken during nearly every orbit for $6.4\,\mathrm{d}$ between July 13 and July 18, 2016 \parencite{mchardy2018x}. The central wavelength of the UVW2 lightcurve is located at about $1930\,\AA$ \parencite{mchardy2018x}. \\
When compared, all measured continuum lightcurves show a roughly similar shape (see Figure \ref{fig:continua_lightcurves}). The lightcurves start at a high flux level, followed by a significant decrease of about $50$--$80\%$ relative to the maximum-to-minimum range of each curve approximately between the 1st and 6th day, with the minimum at around the 4th day. A central region follows, with again high flux with variation depending on the wavelength range of the continua. For the UV continua, this plateau ranges from the 6th to the 9th day and is followed by another smaller decrease in flux between the 9th and 13th day, before it increases again with peak at around the 13th day. Subsequently, the flux decreases, with small interim variation, towards a minimum at the end of the campaign. The continua between $4010\,\AA$ and $6110\,\AA$ also show a plateau-like shape between the 6th and 14th day, except for a small increase in flux between the 7th and 10th day, before decreasing again. The red and NIR continua show a roughly constant plateau between the 8th and 14th day, before decreasing in the same way as the other light curves, with another small, more pronounced flux plateau between the 15th and 17th day. \\
One goal of this reverberation mapping analysis is to estimate the physical distance between the SMBH and the region from which the emission lines originate. Assuming that the continuum radiation originates from the accretion disk, it is common to use the bluest available continuum as reference for the time lag estimation, which is expected to originate closest to the SMBH \parencite{ochmann2026first}. In this case, this would be the continuum around $1150\,\AA$. Nevertheless, the UVW2 continuum was selected as the main reference lightcurve for the subsequent analysis due to its higher sampling rate. To accommodate this, the delay between the UV continuum lightcurve around $1150\,\AA$ and the UVW2 lightcurve has to be taken into account.

\\
Figures \ref{fig:emission_line_lightcurves} and \ref{fig:UV_emission_line_lightcurves} show the lightcurves of the measured broad emission lines in the optical-to-NIR range and in the UV range. Overall, the light curves show a similar shape to the UVW2 lightcurve: a high or increasing flux in the first few days, a pronounced minimum, a plateau-like central part that is fluctuating in some cases, and a decrease towards the end of the campaign. The main exceptions are the OI$\,\lambda 8446$ and HeII$\,\lambda1640$ lightcurves, which are much more scattered than the others. Nevertheless, it is possible to notice a pronounced minimum similar to that in the UVW2 light curve in these curves. By comparing these features, a shift of a few days between the light curves is already apparent. The flux minima of the Balmer lines, OI$\,\lambda 8446$, and HeI$\,\lambda5875$ occur between days 6 and 7, whereas the minima of the HeII light curves and the UV emission lines Ly$\alpha$, SiIV$\,\lambda\lambda 1393,\,1402$, and CIV$\,\lambda\lambda 1548,\,1550$ occur between days 4 and 5. This provides a first estimate of a time lag of about $2$--$3$ days for the first group of emission lines and about $0$--$1$ days for the second group. A more detailed investigation of the time lags is presented in Section \ref{sec:time_lag_bh_mass}. 





\section{Line Profiles}
\label{sec:line_profiles}

The next step of the analysis is the extraction of line profiles of the broad emission lines from both, the AVG and RMS spectrum. By investigation their shape and line width it allows conclusions about the kinematics of the region their originated from. Following the same procedure as for the lightcurve extraction, an underlying linear continuum is interpolated using a chosen blue and red pseudo-continuum for each line in both the AVG and RMS spectra. The selected boundaries of the pseudo-continua are listed in Table \ref{tab:line_profiles_pseudo}. By subtracting this interpolated continuum, a new zero-flux baseline for each line profile gets defined, which allows a better comparison between the line profiles.

Subsequently, the line profile is converted to velocity space using\\ 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:velocity_space}
	v_i = c \cdot \frac{\lambda_i^2 - \lambda_\mathrm{central}^2}{\lambda_i^2 + \lambda_\mathrm{central}^2}.
\end{equation}\\
Here, $\lambda_i$ denotes the wavelength values, $\lambda_\mathrm{central}$ the central wavelength of the emission line in rest-frame and $c$ the speed of light. Finally, the flux is getting normalized to the maximum of each line profile. Figure \ref{fig:line_profiles} shows an overview of the extracted and normalized line profiles.

\subsection{FWHM}

By defining the height of the line profile between its maximum and the zero-flux baseline, the FWHM of each line profile in the AVG and RMS spectrum is measured. This is done by linear interpolation of the two intersections of the line profile at height $0.5$, again performed with GECHO. If no data-point is found at the exact height $0.5$, the two neighboring are taken to linear interpolate the velocity at height $0.5$. With that the FWHM of the Balmer line profiles, the Ly$\alpha$ line profile, the He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$ line profile and the line profile of the duplet C\,\textsc{iv}$\,\lambda\lambda 1548,\,1550$ in both AVG and RMS gets measured, as well as from the RMS line profile of 	He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ and the AVG line profile of 	 He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda1640$. The FWHM of the AVG line profile of He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ has to be estimated by doubling the line width of its red flank, as the left flank is blended by the Fe\,\textsc{ii} band between $4489 \, \AA$  and $4629 \, \AA$. Same follows for the line profiles of N\,\textsc{V}$\,\lambda\lambda 1238,\,1242$ duplet in AVG and RMS, as it is blended with the Ly$\alpha$ line profile. The FWHM of the RMS Line profile of He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda1640$ has to be estimated by double the width of its blue flank as it is blended with the duplet O\,\textsc{III}]$\,\lambda\lambda 1660,\,1666$. Finally, the FWHM of O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ and Si\,\textsc{IV}$\,\lambda\lambda 1393,\,1402$ are not taken into account for the further analysis, due to a very noisy RMS profile in case of the O\,\textsc{i} line and in case of the Si\,\textsc{IV} a overlapping profiles of the duplet and an additional half forbidden O\,\textsc{IV}], which made is difficult estimate the FWHM of its RMS profile. The resulting FWHM are listed in in Table \ref{tab:line_width_FWHM}.

The uncertainties are estimated based on the instrumental dispersion of the grating, the shape of the line profiles (see. Figure \ref{fig:line_profiles}) and the measure method (see Table \ref{tab:stis_gratings} for the gratings). H$\alpha$ and He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$ are measured with the G750L grating with a dispersion of $4.97\,(\text{\AA}/\mathrm{pixel})$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, H$\delta$ and He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ with the G430L grating with a dispersion of $2.73\,(\text{\AA}/\mathrm{pixel})$ and the UV emission lines with the G430L grating with a dispersion of $0.6\,(\text{\AA}/\mathrm{pixel})$
By using Equation \ref{eqn:velocity_space} together with the rest-frame central wavelengths of the emission lines, this corresponds to an equivalent dispersion per pixel in velocity space listed in Table \ref{tab:grating_dispersion}. This dispersion is used as the minimal estimate for the uncertainty estimation. The uncertainties of the RMS profiles of H$\gamma$, H$\delta$, He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$ and He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$  are scaled higher, due to their shape and noise. Higher uncertainties are estimated for the profiles of Ly$\alpha$ as well, as it is blended with absorption in its blue flank as well with the N\,\textsc{V}$\,\lambda\lambda 1238,\,1242$ duplet in its red flank, and for the CIV$\,\lambda\lambda 1548,\,1550$ duplet line profiles as it shows a very asymmetrical shape. Finally, the uncertainties for the AVG and RMS line profiles of He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda1640$, N\,\textsc{V}$\,\lambda\lambda 1238,\,1242$ and the AVG profile of He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ are selected significantly higher, due to their estimation based on the width of only one flank.

\subsection{Balmer-Lines}

A comparison of the Balmer-line profiles H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$ and H$\delta$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:AVG_RMS_Helium} With the exception of the AVG profile of H$\gamma$, which is affected by the narrow [O\,\textsc{iii}] $\lambda4363$ line overlapping the H$\gamma$ profile, the lines exhibit a similar asymmetric shape their AVG profiles. All three lines show a steep blue wing, that broads to a very broad flank at about $\approx -2500\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ exhibit nearly identical gradients, while H$\gamma$ and H$\delta$ shows a more broad flank up to $\approx -2500\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ before matching the slope of the other profiles, which could be explained underlying components of other broad and narrow emission lines. The red wings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ follow a similar pattern, showing a bump at around $\approx 1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and $\approx 2500\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, respectively, resulting in the asymmetric profile and therefore velocity distribution. Looking at the line widths of the AVG profiles, the FWHM differs significantly from each other as the profiles consists of broad and narrow components and in case of H$\gamma$ is overlapped by the [O\,\textsc{iii}] $\lambda4363$ emission line. These narrow components are hard to isolate in the profiles, no attempt was made to decompose the AVG profiles. \\
The RMS profiles of the Balmer lines show an asymmetric double-peaked shape. Again, the profiles of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ show a very similar shape, while the blue wing of H$\gamma$ is more extended and becomes noisy towards increasing negative velocities, resulting in a higher line width compared to H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Since [O III] $\lambda4363$ vanish in the RMS profiles, the red wing of H$\gamma$ becomes clearly visible and follows a similar shape of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. For all three profiles, the double-peaked structure is red-shifted, with the blue peak located at $\approx 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and the red peak at $\approx 2000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, showing that most of the flux variation within the red wing of the emission lines. \\
Taking the strong similarities of the RMS profiles, it can be assumed that H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emerge under similar kinematic properties.

\subsection{Helium-Lines}


Figure \ref{fig:AVG_Helium} shows a comparison of the AVG and RMS line profile of He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  and He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$. The blue wing of the He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ AVG profile is partly overlapped by the Fe\,\textsc{ii} band between $4489 \, \AA$  and $4629 \, \AA$ at velocities above about $-1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. While the visible part of its blue wing follows the same shape as the He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  blue wing shape, the red wing of He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  is much broader. Still, both red wings show a similar shape and an additional smaller peak at around $1000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Since more than half of He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  blue wing is overlapped by the Fe\,\textsc{ii} band, a calculation of its FWHM was not attempted. Still, looking at the the line widths at 0.6 height of the line with $\approx 2500 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  and $\approx 1600 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ for He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ with using the uncertainties from Table \ref{tab:line_width_FWHM}, it can be assumed that He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  show a much broader FWHM in the AVG than He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$. For the same reasons as for the balmer lines, a decomposition of the narrow and broad components was not attempted, which is why the FWHM of the RMS profiles will be used for the subsequent analysis.\\
Other than in the AVG profile, He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  now shows a smaller line width than He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ and higher noise. Looking at the He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  profile, its maximum is red-shifted to $\approx 2000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, while the maximum of the He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ profile is located around $0 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Following that it He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$  shows more variation in its red wing than He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ does. The blue wing of He\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda5875$ extend up to about $\approx -5000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and its red wing about $\approx 4000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ while He\,\textsc{ii}$\,\lambda4685$ blue wing extend up to about $\approx -9000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ its red wing about $\approx 5000\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Going from the maxima, it shows that both profiles show a much more extended blue wing and a very steep red wing.

\section{Bowen Fluorescence of O\,\textsc{I}$\,\lambda 8446$}

Emission lines in the optical range, like the Balmer and helium lines, are commonly used in many reverberation-mapping campaigns, as they are easily accessible for nearby AGN \parencite{ochmann2026first}. Other lines, such as the low-ionization line O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$, have not been of major interest in such campaigns, mostly because of observational limitations \parencite{ochmann2026first}. This is why the variability of the O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ line in this campaign is of particular interest, as the line can be enhanced by Bowen fluorescence, pumped by Ly$\beta$ emission \parencite{grandi1980}. The time delay between the ionizing continuum and O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ should be consistent with a time delay in which continuum
variations drive Ly$\beta$ variations, which in turn drive part of the O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ response. Unfortunately, Ly$\beta$ lies outside the spectral range of the \cite{cackett2018accretion} campaign. However, because the Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ lines are expected to originate under similar physical conditions \parencite{ochmann2026first}, Ly$\alpha$ can be used as a proxy for Ly$\beta$. H$\alpha$ is used to investigate the location of the O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ emitting region relative to the Balmer-line emitting region.\\
Therefore, the time lags between the UVW2 and emission-line lightcurves, as well as the CCFs and time lags between O\,\textsc{i}$,\lambda 8446$ and Ly$\alpha$, between H$\alpha$ and Ly$\alpha$, and between O,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ and H$\alpha$, are calculated and shown in Figure \ref{fig:ccfs_Bowen}. All lightcurve show a strong correlation between $\approx 0.75 - 0.8$, with the exception of the O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ and UVW2 lightcurves, which show a maximum correlation of only $0.6$. The time lags and their uncertainties are calculated as before. O\,\textsc{i}$,\lambda 8446$ lags behind Ly$\alpha$ by $2.5 \ensuremath{{-0.4}^{+1.8}}$ days and behind UVW2 by $5.0 \ensuremath{{-1.7}^{+2.1}}$ days, while H$\alpha$ lags behind Ly$\alpha$ by $1.8 \ensuremath{{-0.5}^{+0.5}}$ days and behind UVW2 by $3.3 \ensuremath{{-0.7}^{+1.0}}$ days. A difference in the response time of about $0.5$--$1$ days between O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ and H$\alpha$ is noticeable, but are not significant within the uncertainties. Looking at the O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ and H$\alpha$ lightcurves, they also show a strong correlation, with O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ lagging behind H$\alpha$ by about $0.3 \ensuremath{_{-0.1}^{+2.0}}$ days. With the Ly$\alpha$ light curve lagging behind the UVW2 light curve by $1.1 \ensuremath{_{-0.2}^{+0.4}}$ days, the total lag along the Bowen-fluorescence path from UVW2 to Ly$\alpha$ and from Ly$\alpha$ to O\,\textsc{i}$\,\lambda 8446$ sums to $\approx 3.6$ days, which lies within the uncertainties of the time lag between the H$\alpha$ and UVW2 light curves.

\section{Black Hole Mass}

Having obtained the time lags as well as the line widths of the selected broad emission lines, the mass of the SMBH can now be estimated using the virial theorem following the method of \cite{peterson2004}. Taking equation \ref{eqn:charc_radius}, \ref{eqn:M_vir} and \ref{eqn:M_BH} the SMBH mass can be estimated for each of the selected emission lines: 
\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:BHM}
	M_{\mathrm{BH}} = f \cdot \frac{c \cdot \tau_{\mathrm{centroid}}\,\Delta V^2}{G}\,.
\end{equation}
The parameters are defined like described in section \ref{subsec:BHM}. The velocity dispersion $\Delta V^2$ is parameterized by the line width of the emission line profile, which is measured using the FWHM of the RMS line profile. Following \cite{probst2025emissionlinecontinuumreverberationmapping} a scale factor of $f=1.8$ gets assumed, that accounts the relation $\mathrm{FWHM}/\sigma_{\mathrm{line}} \approx 2$ \parencite{peterson2004}. The resulting SMBH mass results, as well as the corresponding time lag and FWHM values of the broad emission lines are listed in Table \ref{tab:BH_mass}. \\
To estimate a mean value of the BH mass, the inverse-variance weighted mean is calculated. Since the uncertainties are asymmetric a symmetrized 1$\sigma$ uncertainty for the weights gets adopter, $\sigma_i=(\sigma_i^-+\sigma_i^+)/2$.
The weighted mean is then given by
\begin{equation}
	\bar{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}=\frac{\sum_i w_i M_{\mathrm{BH},i}}{\sum_i w_i}\,,\qquad
	w_i=\frac{1}{\sigma_i^2}\,,
\end{equation}
with an uncertainty
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\bar{M}}=\left(\sum_i w_i\right)^{-1/2}\,.
\end{equation}
This yields the weighted-mean SMBH mass of $\bar{M}_{\mathrm{BH}}\approx (0.975 \pm 0.131)\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$.\\
It has to be noted, that the scale factor of $f=1.8$ does not account the low-inclination $i \sim 11^\circ$ of the elliptic accretion disk, modeled in \cite{ochmann2024transient}. Adopting the scaling relation $f \sim \sin^{-2}(i)$ introduced by \cite{krolik2001systematic}, a value of $f \sim 27.5$ would be needed to account for the low inclination. \cite{krolik2001systematic} used the line dispersion to parameterize the velocity dispersion, which is why the relation $\sigma_{\mathrm{line}} \approx \mathrm{FWHM}/2$ \parencite{peterson2004} has to be accounted again. Due to the square relation of the velocity dispersion to the black hole mass seen in Equation \ref{eqn:BHM}, the scale factor finally gets corrected to a value $f \sim 6.8$. Subsequently the found BH mass has to be multiplied by a additional factor of $3.77$. \\
Subsequently, the weighted-mean SMBH mass yields $\bar{M}_{\mathrm{BH,corr}} \approx (3.68 \pm 0.49)\times 10^{7}\,M_\odot$.
