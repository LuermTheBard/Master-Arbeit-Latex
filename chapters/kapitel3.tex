\section{Line Identification}

Having obtained the AVG- and RMS spectrum of NGC4593, the next step is the identification of the emission lines. Figures  \ref{fig:AVG_RMS_SPECTRUM} and \ref{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS} show the optical to near-infrared range between $3900 \AA$ and $9000 \AA$ and  the UV range between $1100 \AA$ and $1700 \AA$, respectively.

\end{figure}

\newpage

Looking at Figure \ref{fig:AVG_RMS_SPECTRUM}, the most prominent broad emission lines in the AVG spectrum are the Balmer-Lines, with H$\alpha$ being the strongest followed by H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$. Their variations are clearly visible in the RMS spectrum and the line profiles of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in particular show strong similarities, which will be discussed in more detail later in this chapter. In addition to the Balmer emission lines, several He-emission lines such as He\,II $\lambda 4685$, He\,I $\lambda 5875$ and He\,I $\lambda 7065$ show  variability. Another significant broad emission line complex appears in the NIR part of the spectrum, including the O\,I $\lambda 8446$ and Ca\,II lines. The O\,I $\lambda 8446$ line is of particular interest in this thesis, as it shows variability that has never been measured using reverberation mapping before. \\
Apart from the broad emission lines, the AVG spectrum also exhibits several strong forbidden emission lines with the [O\,III] $\lambda 5007$ and the [O\,III] $\lambda 4958$ as the most prominent ones. As mentioned in the previous chapter, the first one was used for the intercalibration of the spectra and, as expected, shows no variability in the RMS spectrum, similar to the other forbidden lines. Finally, the AVG spectrum shows additionally two Fe II emission line groups, that shows no variation in the RMS spectrum.

	\label{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS}
\end{figure}


The UV spectrum shown in Figure \ref{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS} contains both broad and semi-forbidden emission lines. In addition to the prominent Si and C broad emission lines, it shows strong and variable Ly$\alpha$ emission, which is of particular significance for this thesis. \\
The Bowen fluorescence of O\,I $\lambda 8446$, which is investigated in this analysis, is typical driven by the emission of the Ly$\beta$ line \parencite{grandi1980}, which lies outside the spectral range of the HST Campaign. However, as can be seen in figure \ref{fig:UV_uncalibrated_AVG_RMS}, Ly$\alpha$  still lies in the spectral range of the campaign, as the bluest broad line of the taken spectra. As Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ are assumed to originate in the same physical region, Ly$_\alpha$ can be used to examine the corelation of O\,I $\lambda 8446$ and Ly$\alpha$ for Bowen fluorescence.
 
 




\section{Emission Line and Continua Measurement}

After identifying the emission lines, the next step of the analysis is to calculate the fluxes of those lines. This is done with the help of a python-based tool called GECHO created by M. Probst. It enables to import full campaigns, determine the AVG and RMS spectra, extracting lightcurves and do further measurments, like e.g. ICCF methode to measure lags and line-wifth measurments \parencite{gaskell_peterson1986, peterson2004}, which will be further discussed in Section \ref{sec:time_lag_bh_mass}\\
With help of GECHO the flux density gets integrated over the extent of each emission line for every observed spectrum of the campaign. Here it is important to define the integration limits so that all of the emission line flux is measured in this way. To ensure this, a parallel view of the AVG- and RMS-spectrum was used to define those integration limits, and to ensured, that no component of any other line is contributing to the line flux of the measured line. But before the line flux can be calculated, the surrounding continuum has to be subtracted, which can be done by interpolating a linear underlying continuum between sections on the blue and red side with no line contribution. The chosen integration limits and pseudo-continua can be found in Table \ref{tab:emission_lines}. With the fluxes of each line now derived from all observed spectra, it is possible to extract the lightcurves of the measured emission line, which will be further covered in the next section.\\
Besides the emission line lightcurves, continua lightcurves from different wavelength ranges are required for the further analysis. The extraction process is similar to the emission line lightcurves, except that they get calculated by the mean flux density of a sufficiently large region without line emission or absorption. Therefore, no pseudo-continuum subtraction is necessary. The chosen integration limits for the continua can be found in Table \ref{tab:continua}.\\

\subsection{Variability Statistics}

To quantify the variability of the emission lines and continua variability statistics, defined by  \cite{rodriguez1997steps} gets adopted. This definition includes the extrema of the emission line flux densities as well as the extrema of the integrated continuum fluxes, $F_\mathrm{min}$ and $F_\mathrm{max}$, the maximum-to-minimum flux ratio $R_\mathrm{max}$, the mean flux $\langle F \rangle$, the standard deviation $\sigma_F$, and finally the fractional variability, which is defined as: 
\begin{equation}
	F_\mathrm{var}=\frac{\sqrt{\sigma_F^2-\Delta^2}}{\left<F\right>}
\end{equation}
Here $\Delta^2$ is the mean square value of the uncertainties of the fluxes defined as:
\begin{equation}
	\Delta^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\Delta_i^2
\end{equation}
The results of these parameters can be found in Table \ref{tab:varstatistics}. \\

\section{Lightcurves}

The variability of the lightcurves can be seen in the visualization of the lightcurves in Figure \ref{fig:continua_lightcurves} and \ref{fig:emission_line_lightcurves}. In addition to the measured lightcurves of the HST campaign, the UVOT UVW2 lightcurve taken with SWIFT by \cite{mchardy2018x} is displayed for comparison which shows a higher sample-size that the lightcurves of the HST campaign. Its central wavelength is located at about 1930\,\AA\, \parencite{mchardy2018x} and was used as a reference lightcurve in \cite{cackett2018accretion} as well, which makes is interesting as a reference lightcurve for this analysis too. \\
Looking at the  continuum lightcurves in Figure \ref{fig:continua_lightcurves} they show a broadly similar overall shape. All lightcurves begin at the highest flux level in most cases, except for UVW2, whose peaks have comparable heights throughout, and the 1150 continuum, which reaches its highest flux at the second maximum. The initial maximum is followed by a pronounced flux minimum, with a decrease of about $25$--$46\%$ relative to the overall maximum flux of each curve. Subsequently, the light curves rise again toward another peak, which is more distinct in the UV and blue continua and is followed by another drop in flux. While all continua except Cont. 4010 exhibit an additional another local maximum, the flux then decline steadily toward a global minimum near the end of the campaign.

	\label{fig:emission_line_lightcurves}
\end{figure}
\\
For the RM analysis the real distance between the SMBH and the BLR is of most interests. Assuming that the continuum radiation originate from the accretion disk it is common to use the bluest available continuum band, which is
expected to originate closest to the SMBH, which would be the continuum around 1150 \AA. But because the higher sample rate, the UVW2 continuum was selected as the main reference lightcurve for the further analysis. \\
Looking now at the emission-line lightcurves in Figure \ref{fig:emission_line_lightcurves} correlation between them and the UVW2 continuum can already be spotted. The three major features of the UVW2 lightcurve, the first strong minimum, the two maxima in the center and the strong drop at the end, can be also identified in the emission line lightcurves with respective shifts in time, which will be further investigated in Section \ref{sec:time_lag_bh_mass}.

\section{Line Profiles}

To investigate the kinematics of the BLR, the AVG and RMS line profile from the selected broad emission lines H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, Ly$\alpha$, HeII$\,\lambda$4685, HeI$\,\lambda5875$ and OI$\,\lambda 8446$ has been extracted. Following the same procedure as for the lightcurve extraction, a linear underlying continuum gets interpolated using a chosen red and blue pseudo-continua for each line in either the AVG and RMS spectrum. By subtracting this underlying continuum the true line profile can be extracted. The selected boundaries of the pseudo-continua are shown in Table \ref{tab:line_profiles_pseudo}.  \\

More interesting are the RMS line profiles that show a overall similar shape, which can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:RMS_Balmer}. All three profiles show a asymmetric double peaked shape with a higher flux in the more blue peak.
